The DFS Algorithm:
Step 1: Assign status 1 (ready status) to all nodes in the graph.

Step 2: Push the starting node onto the stack and assign it status 2 (visiting status).

Step 3: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the stack is empty.

Step 4: Pop the top node from the stack, process it, and assign it status 3 (visited status).

Step 5: Push all unvisited neighbours of the current node onto the stack and assign them status 2 (visiting status).

Step 6: Terminate the process.

DFS Pseudocode:
DFS(G, v)   ( v is the vertex where the search starts )
Stack S := {};   (Initialize an empty stack S)
For each vertex u in G, set visited[u] := false;
Push v onto S;
While S is not empty, do the following:
u = pop S;
If u has not been visited, then
Mark u as visited;
For each unvisited neighbour w of u,
Push w onto S;
End if
End while
END DFS
