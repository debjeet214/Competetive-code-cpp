This code solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using a recursive approach. The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you have to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed a given limit (knapsack capacity).

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

Function max(int a, int b): This is a utility function that takes two integers as input and returns the maximum of the two.

Function knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n): This is the main function that implements the recursive approach to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. It takes four arguments:

W: The capacity of the knapsack (maximum weight that the knapsack can hold).
wt[]: An array representing the weights of the items.
val[]: An array representing the values of the items.
n: The number of items.
Inside this function:

If either n becomes 0 (meaning no more items to consider) or W becomes 0 (meaning the knapsack capacity is exhausted), it returns 0, indicating that there is no value to be added.
If the weight of the n-th item is greater than the available capacity W, it recursively calls the knapSack function with n-1, excluding the n-th item.
Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value by considering two possibilities:
Including the n-th item and recursively calling knapSack with W-wt[n-1] (reducing the capacity by the weight of the n-th item) and n-1 (excluding the n-th item).
Excluding the n-th item and recursively calling knapSack with the same capacity W and n-1 (excluding the n-th item).
It returns the maximum of these two possibilities.
Function main(): This is the entry point of the program where the sample inputs are defined and the knapSack function is called with those inputs.

It initializes arrays profit[] and weight[] representing the values and weights of the items, respectively.
It initializes the knapsack capacity W.
It calculates the number of items n.
It calls the knapSack function with the given inputs and prints the result, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained.
The program demonstrates a simple recursive approach to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem. However, it may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs due to its exponential time complexity. Dynamic programming can be used to optimize the solution and improve its time complexity.
